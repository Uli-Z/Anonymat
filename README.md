# Local Text Anonymizer  

## Description  
**Local Text Anonymizer** fills a gap for professional environments where the use of AI tools for text translation, correction, or improvement is severely limited by data protection regulations.  
This lightweight, browser-based tool enables semi-automated anonymization of sensitive text, making it safe to use with external AI APIs — and just as easily allows re-identification of the text afterward.  

The tool runs as a single HTML file directly in the browser on almost any office machine.  
A simple, clean user interface ensures anonymization can be done with minimal effort and time.  

> Important: This is a partial automation tool. Final responsibility for proper anonymization remains with the user.

## Why GDPR-compliant?  
All processing happens in your browser, offline, without external servers.  
This ensures that the tool can be used within GDPR-regulated environments and respects strict corporate privacy policies.

## How It Works  
1. Download the file dist/Anonymat.html and open the HTML file in your browser.  
2. Paste or type the text.  
3. Click `Anonymize` — detected personal data will be replaced by placeholders.  
4. Edit or process the anonymized text in external tools.  
5. Paste the processed text back into the tool and click `Deanonymize` to restore the original data.

## Limitations  
- The tool provides **semi-automated** anonymization;  
- Complex text structures or unusual data formats might not be detected automatically.  
- **The final responsibility for checking and verifying the anonymized text lies with the user.**
